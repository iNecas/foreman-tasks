Clean tasks based on filter and age. ENV variables:

  * TASK_SEARCH : scoped search filter (example: 'label = "Actions::Foreman::Host::ImportFacts"')
  * AFTER       : delete tasks created after *AFTER* period. Expected format is a number followed by the time unit (s,h,m,y), such as '10d' for 10 days
  * STATES      : comma separated list of task states to touch with the cleanup, by default only stopped tasks are covered
  * NOOP        : set to "true" if the task should not actuall perform the deletion
  * VERBOSE     : set to "true" for more verbose output
  * BATCH_SIZE  : the size of batches the tasks get processed in (1000 by default)

If none of TASK_SEARCH, BEFORE, STATES is specified, the tasks will be cleaned based
configuration in settings
